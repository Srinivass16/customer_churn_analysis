# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis 


## Problem Statement

This analysis helps the telecom company understand their customers better, particularly their satisfaction with the services provided. The dataset includes columns with demographic and geographic information, details about referrals made by customers, and various services the customers have subscribed to, such as internet and streaming services etc . There are also columns related to payment and revenue, as well as a customer status column that indicates whether the customer has churned or is still with the company and to Identify the overall executive Summary and also the main objective of this data analysis project is to conduct an in-depth examination of Telecom Customer Churn analysis. The project aims to identify early indicators and patterns associated with customer churn. 

By deriving actionable insights from the data, the project seeks to provide valuable business operational and customer experience insights. 
The ultimate goal is to equip the telecom company with actionable findings that can guide targeted retention efforts, effectively reducing customer churn and contributing to overall business sustainability and growth.

### Project Golas

Create an entire ETL process in a database and a power bi dashboard to utilize the customer data and achive the below goals 

    1. Analyse Customer Data at below levels 
      a. Demographic
      b. Geographic 
      c. Payment and account info 
      d. Services 
    2. Study Churner profile and identify areas for implementing marketing campaings
    3. Identify a Method to predict future churners 

    Metrics Required 
    1. Total Customer
    2. Total churn and churn rate 
    3. New joiners    

### ETL Framework 
    Our framework uses below componenets:
    - CSV file - This is our source file 
    - SQL server management studio - we will use its inbuilt import wizard to transform and load data 
    - SQL server database - This is where our final data will be loaded and host our data warehouse , tables and views for final usage 

    Alternative framework    
    - CSV file - This is our source file 
    -  SQL Server integration services - we can use custome made ssis package to transform and load data.Thia is usually used when you have ecurring data loads and you want to automate the process
    - SQL server database - Packages loads our final data into the data warehouse in SQL server 


### SQL Queries 

#### Data Exploration to Check Distinct Values

    INTO [db_Churn].[dbo].[prod_Churn]
    FROM [db_Churn].[dbo].[stg_Churn];


#### Create View for Power BI
    Create View vw_ChurnData as
	select * from prod_Churn where Customer_Status In ('Churned', 'Stayed')

    Create View vw_JoinData as
	select * from prod_Churn where Customer_Status = 'Joined'

### Power Query Transformations & Measures
#### Add a new column in prod_Churn
    1.Churn Status = if [Customer_Status] = "Churned" then 1 else 0
    2.Change Churn Status data type to numbers
    3.Monthly Charge Range = if [Monthly_Charge] < 20 then "< 20" else if [Monthly_Charge] < 50 then "20-50" else if [Monthly_Charge] < 100 then "50-100" else "> 100"

#### Create a New Table Reference for mapping_AgeGrp
    1.Keep only Age column and remove duplicates
    2.Age Group = if [Age] < 20 then "< 20" else if [Age] < 36 then "20 - 35" else if [Age] < 51 then "36 - 50" else "> 50"
    3.AgeGrpSorting = if [Age Group] = "< 20" then 1 else if [Age Group] = "20 - 35" then 2 else if [Age Group] = "36 - 50" then 3 else 4
    4.Change data type of AgeGrpSorting

#### Create a new table reference for mapping_TenureGrp
    1.Keep only Tenure_in_Months and remove duplicates
    2.Tenure Group = if [Tenure_in_Months] < 6 then "< 6 Months" else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 12 then "6-12 Months" else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 18 then "12-18 Months" else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 24 then "18-24 Months" else ">= 24 Months"
    3.TenureGrpSorting = if [Tenure_in_Months] = "< 6 Months" then 1 else if [Tenure_in_Months] =  "6-12 Months" then 2 else if [Tenure_in_Months] = "12-18 Months" then 3 else if [Tenure_in_Months] = "18-24 Months " then 4 else 5
    4.Change data type of TenureGrpSorting  

#### Create a new table reference for prod_Services
    1.Unpivot services columns
    2.Rename Column â€“ 
    a.Attribute >> Services 
    b.Value >> Status

#### Summary Page - Measures

    Total Customers = Count(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])

    New Joiners = CALCULATE(COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID]), prod_Churn[Customer_Status] = "Joined")

    Total Churn = SUM(prod_Churn[Churn Status]) 

    Churn Rate = [Total Churn] / [Total Customers]
